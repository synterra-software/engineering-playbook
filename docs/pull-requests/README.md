# Pull Request Guidelines

## Creating Pull Requests

### PR Status and Ownership
* Every PR that is not ready for review must be marked as **Draft**
* Each PR must have at least two assigned reviewers
* If you have a colleague who works on the same module or same task - their review is **required**
* The PR creator is fully responsible for their PR through the entire lifecycle
* **PR creator is responsible** for resolving merge conflicts

### PR Content Requirements
* Include screenshot(s) of the UI implementation to help reviewers understand the changes

### Approval Requirements
* **At least 2 approvals are required** before merging any PR
* One of these approvals must be from a colleague working on the same module/task when applicable

### ðŸŒ¿ Branching Strategy

Each branch must include the project ticket number for traceability:

1. **`main`** â€“ Stable production branch.
2. **`develop`** â€“ Integration branch for all features.
3. **`feature/PROJECT-XXX-description`** â€“ New features (e.g., `feature/PROJECT-001-user-authentication`).
4. **`bugfix/PROJECT-XXX-description`** â€“ Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/PROJECT-045-fix-login-error`).
5. **`hotfix/PROJECT-XXX-description`** â€“ Critical fixes for `main`.
6. **`release/{version}`** â€“ Prepares a release before merging into `main`.
7. **`chore/PROJECT-XXX-description`** â€“ Routine tasks (e.g., `chore/PROJECT-010-update-dependencies`).

### ðŸ“œ Commit Message Format

Format:

```
<type>: <message>
```

Example:

```

```

Commit Types:

- **`feat`** â€“ A new feature
- **`fix`** â€“ A bug fix
- **`docs`** â€“ Documentation updates
- **`style`** â€“ Code style changes (no logic changes)
- **`refactor`** â€“ Code restructuring (no functional changes)
- **`perf`** â€“ Performance improvements

* **Code Quality**: Check for maintainability, readability, and adherence to project conventions? (TBD)
* **Functionality**: Ensure the code fulfills its intended purpose? (TBD)
* **Performance**: Watch for inefficient code or potential bottlenecks? (TBD)
* **Security**: Identify any security vulnerabilities or risks? (TBD)

### Review Comments
* Be specific about what needs to be changed and why
* Offer suggestions for improvement when possible
* Use "Request changes" for required modifications
* Use "Approve" only when confident the code is ready to merge
