# Frontend Developer - Definition of Done

## üîç Important Note for All Developers
We're committed to delivering high-quality code that meets all our standards. To ensure this:

* During PR review, reviewers will check for: missing TypeScript types , hardcoded colors, hardcoded strings, directional CSS properties, and proper roles/aria-labels ‚úì
* If QA finds any incomplete items from this list, the task will be returned to development
* When this happens, please prioritize fixing these items before starting new work

### Let's maintain our quality standards together!

---

## Acceptance Criteria
* All acceptance criteria are fully met (every point checked).
* Any edge cases identified during development are handled.

## Design Fidelity
* UI matches Figma design pixel-perfect:
    * Spacing and layout match specifications
    * Colors are never hardcoded - all colors must use theme variables
    * Typography (font family, size, weight, line height) matches design
    * All responsive breakpoints behave correctly
    * Animations and transitions match design intent
    * All states (hover, focus, active, disabled) are implemented

## Build Integrity
* Project builds successfully without issues (npm run dist).
* No console errors in development or production builds.

## Code Quality
* No TypeScript errors or red flags in the IDE.
* All components and functions have proper TypeScript typing.
* No "any" type usage without explicit justification.
* SonarQube analysis passes without new issues.


## Internationalization (i18n)
* All text is in i18n files ‚Äì no hardcoded strings.
* Date, time, currency and number formats respect locale.
* UI accommodates text expansion/contraction for different languages.

## Bidirectional Support
* UI fully supports both LTR and RTL directions.
* No use of directional CSS properties (padding-left/right, margin-left/right, etc.).
* Use logical properties instead (padding-inline-start/end, margin-inline-start/end, etc.).

## Test Automation Readiness
* **Role attribute**: Defines what an element does in the UI
    * Add to non-semantic elements (div/span used as buttons, menus, etc.)
    * Follow [standard ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)

* **Aria-label attribute**: Describes what the element does or represents
    * Required for: elements without visible text, icons, similar elements with different functions
    * Make labels action-oriented and concise ("Submit form", "Open menu")

## Component Design? (TBD)
* Components are modular, reusable, and maintainable? (TBD)
* Props have sensible defaults where appropriate? (TBD)
* Component follows single responsibility principle? (TBD)

## Performance? (TBD)
* Component renders efficiently without unnecessary re-renders? (TBD)
* React hooks follow dependency rules? (TBD)
* Large lists use virtualization where appropriate? (TBD)

## Testing? (TBD)
* Unit tests cover component logic? (TBD)
* Integration tests verify component behavior? (TBD)
* Test coverage meets project requirements? (TBD)
